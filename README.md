<h1 align="left">Game made as a project for my IT class.</h1>

###

<p align="left">It's a game where you play as a student of my school who woke up in the middle of the night in class. He starts to see strange things. Goal is simple to collect all artifacts but the goal of my team was different. We tried to make game look as psx style as it was possible. All textures and models are in the psx style. To create the horror atmosphere we decided to make building where the game is set (building of our school fully recreated by our team) liminal.</p>

<p align="left">This project was interesting because it was first time where i was using some sort of tools like google drive or trello to cooperate with my friends.</p>
